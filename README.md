## Security

BKPassword takes a comprehensive approach to security:

- **Strong Encryption**: All passwords are encrypted using AES-256 before storing in localStorage
- **Secure Key Derivation**: The encryption key is derived using PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Uses a combination of hardware and browser characteristics to create a unique device fingerprint
- **Zero Data Transmission**: No data is ever sent to any server - everything stays on your device
- **No Backdoors**: Your passwords remain accessible only on the device where they were created
- **Open Source**: Security through transparency - the code is open for anyone to audit
